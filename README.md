# 🚀 Carl Jean Camarao - **Data Analysis Portfolio** 📊

## 🧐 About
Hi, I'm Carl Jean. I'm a 22-year-old self-learning aspiring data analyst/scientist. I find data analytics to be an important role for companies to develop efficiently, which is why I wanted to join this journey. Another thing I like to do is using what I know to help resolve problems and using my insights to identify different solutions.

Over these past few years, I wanted to replace my hobbies with things that I can build with. So, I focused my energy on learning skills that I can create my future with. Now, in my free time, I like to **📊 build data projects, 📈 trade options in the stock market, and 📚 read history books**.

I have worked on projects that involve **🔮 forecasting, 📊 visualization, 🏢 attrition analysis, and 🤖 prediction**, and I enjoy facing real-world problems then turning raw data into meaningful insights. It kind of like playing a game to me. While I’m open to working in various industries, my primary focus is on **building a strong career in data analytics** and continuously improving my technical and analytical skills.

💡 **Fun History Fact:** The **Federal Reserve** was created via a bill that private bankers organized and lobbied into government. Then they were able to get positions in the Federal Reserve. 🏦💰
